- 👋 Hi, I’m Maya Nicole Dummett. I am a First-Year @ Harvard.
- 👀 I am a student organizer, an advocate, and a coder who is passionate about the intersection of computer science and government for social good/social justice causes. I am particularly passionate about advancing racial equity, advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, centering youth wellbeing in digital spaces, engaging folks civically, and brainstorming how technology and public policy may work together (and sometimes, separately) to create a better world.
- 🌱 I am proficient in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that support social issues/progressive causes!
- 📫 How to reach me: Maya Dummett on LinkedIn (https://linkedin.com/in/mayadummett)
