- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maya Nicole Dummett. I am a rising junior @ Harvard studying computer science and government with an interest for how computer science and government can intersect for social justice causes. I am especially passionate about advancing racial equity in all facets of life, advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, engaging folks civically, and brainstorming how technology and government might work together (and independently) to create a better, more just and fair world.
